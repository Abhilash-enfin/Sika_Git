        <div class="paragraph"><em>Last Updated: June 2, 2025</em></div>
        <div class="rich-text-block w-richtext">
          <p>Sika Health, Inc. (“<strong>Sika,</strong>” “<strong>we,</strong>” or “<strong>our</strong>”) provides (1) a platform that allows merchants to accept FSA and/or HSA funds as a payment method at checkout by determining whether a purchase is FSA and/or HSA eligible, (2) if appropriate, enables a service through which eligible customers may obtain a letter of medical necessity (“<strong>LMN</strong>”) through an independent practitioner to support the purchase with HSA/FSA funds, and  (3) a marketplace that showcases HSA/FSA-eligible products from independent third-party merchants (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>”).  </p>
          <p>Please read these Terms of Service (the “<strong>Terms</strong>”) and our Privacy Policy (“<strong>Privacy Polic</strong>y”) carefully because they govern your use of the Services.</p>
          <ol role="list">
            <li><strong>Agreement to Terms</strong>. These Terms are a binding legal agreement between you and Sika. <strong>If you don’t agree to be bound by these Terms, do not accept them, and do not use the Services.</strong> </li>
            <li><strong>Privacy Policy</strong>. Please review our <a class="text-link" href="https://www.sikahealth.com/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, which also governs your use of the Services, for information on how we collect, use, and share your information. </li>
            <li><strong>Who May Use the Services?</strong> You may use the Services only if you are 18 years or older (or the age of majority in your state of residence, whichever is higher), a US resident, are capable of forming a binding contract with Sika, and not otherwise barred from using the Services under applicable law.  Any access to, or use of, the Service by non-U.S. residents is strictly prohibited and in violation of these Terms. We make no representations that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations. By using the Service, you represent that you are a U.S. resident.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>ARBITRATION NOTICE: EXCEPT IF YOU OPT-OUT AND EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION SECTION BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND SIKA WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. YOU CAN OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT BY CONTACTING SUPPORT@SIKAHEALTH.COM WITHIN 30 DAYS OF ACCEPTING THESE TERMS.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>TERMS OF SERVICE</strong></p>
          <p><strong>1. Changes to these Terms or the Services</strong>. With the exception of the Arbitration Agreement (see Section 11), we may update the Terms from time to time in our sole discretion. If we do, we’ll let you know by posting the updated Terms on the Sika website currently located at <a class="text-link" href="https://sikahealth.com">https://sikahealth.com,</a> and we may send other communications at our discretion or if required by applicable law. If you continue to use the Services after we have posted updated Terms, it means that you accept and agree to the changes. If you don’t agree to be bound by the changes, you may not use the Services anymore. Because our Services evolve over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion. </p>
          <p><strong>2. Intellectual Property Rights and Limited License</strong>. We may make available through the Services content that is subject to intellectual property rights.

          <p><b>(m).</b> Impersonate or misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity; </p>

          <p><b>(p).</b> Violate any applicable law or regulation; or</p>
          <p><b>(q).</b> Encourage or enable any other individual to do any of the foregoing.</p>
          <p>Sika is not obligated to monitor access to or use of the Services. However, we have the right to do so for the purpose of operating the Services, to ensure compliance with these Terms, and to comply with applicable law or other legal requirements. We have the right to investigate conduct that affects the Services or violations of these Terms. We may also consult and cooperate with law enforcement authorities to prosecute users who violate the law.<strong>‍</strong></p>
          <p><strong>4. Letters of Medical Necessity.</strong>.</p>
          <p><b>(a).</b> Any LMNs and services relating to the provision of (or decision not to provide) an LMN through the Services are provided by independent practitioners (“<strong>LMN Services</strong>” as provided by “<strong>LMN Service Providers</strong>”).  Accordingly, if you choose to utilize the LMN Services, you may be subject to additional terms and conditions, including signing a <strong>Consent to Arrange Telehealth Appointment and Obtain Letter of Medical Necessity (“LMN Consent”)</strong>.  To the extent applicable, you will receive a notification and have the opportunity to review, complete, and sign an LMN Consent.  IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THOSE ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AND/OR CONSENT, DO NOT USE THE RELATED LMN SERVICES.</p>
          <p><b>(b).</b> In the event of any inconsistency between terms of use relating to LMN Services and these Terms, these Terms will control with respect to such LMN Services, unless otherwise expressly set forth in the LMN Consent. LMN Service Providers may collect and use certain information about you, as specified in the LMN Service Provider’s privacy policies. Prior to providing information to any LMN Service Provider, you should review their privacy policy. IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF AN LMN SERVICE PROVIDER’S PRIVACY POLICY OR TERMS OF USE, YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE RELATED LMN SERVICES. WE WILL NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY OF YOUR INFORMATION COLLECTED OR USED BY THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS.</p>
          <p><b>(c).</b> To the extent you desire to obtain a LMN, any such LMN will be based on personal health data and related information you provide via our Services. If you do not provide complete and accurate personal health information, the LMN you receive may not be accurate or appropriate. Questions and information collected through our platform in connection with the Services are designed for informational purposes and to facilitate the generation of a LMN for eligible customers. The Services and/or any data derived in connection with your use of the Services are in no way intended to replace the independent clinical judgment of a qualified healthcare professional. Further, in connection with LMNs, Sika is not responsible for retaining your personal health information in accordance with applicable medical retention rules. This is the responsibility of the LMN Service Providers, who are legally obligated to and will maintain such information in accordance with all applicable medical retention laws, rules, and regulations.</p>
          <p><b>(d).</b> LMN Service Providers are independent practitioners that provide LMN Services. LMN Service Providers may determine that you are not eligible for an LMN, in which case you will have no recourse against Sika. Sika has no, and expressly disclaims any, responsibility for any LMN Service Provider’s decision whether to issue you an LMN. </p>
          <p>ANY MEDICAL ADVICE PROVIDED TO YOU BY AN LMN SERVICE PROVIDER OR ANY OTHER PROFESSIONAL IN CONNECTION WITH THE LMN SERVICES OR OTHERWISE IS NOT UNDER OUR CONTROL, NOR DO WE PROVIDE IT TO YOU OR USE IT.  </p>
          <p><b>(e).</b> By accepting these terms or by using the Services, you agree and acknowledge that Sika does not provide healthcare diagnosis and/or treatment services. Our role is limited to supporting and facilitating your ability to use your FSA and/or HSA funds as a payment method to acquire goods from third-party merchants, and to the extent needed facilitating eligible customers’ ability to use these funds by obtaining a LMN.  YOU AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SIKA IS IN NO WAY PROVIDING DIAGNOSIS OR TREATMENT TO YOU. YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE INFORMATION, PROCESSES, PRODUCTS, AND OTHER ITEMS REFERENCED AS PART OF THE SERVICES ARE NOT INTENDED AS A RECOMMENDATION OR ENDORSEMENT OF ANY COURSE OF ACTION, INFORMATION, OR PRODUCT. SIKA EXPLICITLY DISCLAIMS THE CREATION OF A PROVIDER-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU, AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY SUCH RELATIONSHIP IS BETWEEN YOU AND THE LMN SERVICE PROVIDER.</p>
          <p><b>(f).</b> THE SERVICES CANNOT, AND ARE NOT DESIGNED, INTENDED, OR APPROPRIATE TO, REPLACE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS AND PATIENTS OR TO ADDRESS SERIOUS, EMERGENT, OR LIFE-THREATENING MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. If you are a user and you or someone you know believes you are suffering an emergent or life-threatening condition, call 9-1-1 immediately where that service is available or go to the nearest open clinic or emergency room.</p>
          <p><strong>5. Sika Marketplace</strong> </p>
          <p><b>(a).</b> <strong>Marketplace Services.</strong> Through our marketplace platform (currently available at <a class="text-link" href="https://shop.sika.com/">shop.sika.com</a>, our “<strong>Marketplace</strong>”), we act solely as a technology intermediary by syncing and categorizing HSA/FSA-eligible products from third-party merchants (“<strong>Merchants</strong>”), facilitating HSA/FSA-compliant payment processing, and passing your orders to the relevant Merchant for fulfillment. We do not own or sell the products listed on our platform. All product inventory, pricing, descriptions, and fulfillment are the sole responsibility of the respective Merchant.</p>
          <p><b>(b).</b> <strong>Product Listings & Accuracy.</strong> We rely on Merchants to provide product data and eligibility status. While we make efforts to ensure accurate listings of HSA/FSA-eligible items, we do not guarantee compliance or accept liability for any inaccuracies. You are solely responsible for ensuring your purchase meets HSA/FSA eligibility requirements.</p>
          <p><b>(c).</b> <strong>Order Processing.</strong> Once your payment is completed through our Marketplace, your order will be automatically transmitted to the corresponding Merchant. Merchants are solely responsible for shipping, handling, and customer support regarding product delivery. We do not manage inventory or shipping of any products purchased through our Marketplace.</p>
          <p><b>(d).</b> <strong>Refunds and Returns.</strong> Refunds and returns for Marketplace purchases are managed directly by the respective Merchant through a refund management portal we provide. Each Merchant may have its own return policy. We are not liable for any disputes related to refunds or returns.</p>
          <p><strong>6. Links to Third Party Websites or Resources.</strong> The Services may allow you to access third-party websites or other resources. We provide access only as a convenience and are not responsible for the content, products or services on or available from those resources or links displayed on such websites. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any third-party resources. When you make a purchase through our Marketplace, you may be directed to Merchant websites for order tracking or customer support. We are not responsible for the content, products, or services on or available from those Merchant websites.</p>
          <p><strong>7. Suspension & Termination.</strong> We may suspend or terminate your access to and use of the Services at our sole discretion, at any time and without notice to you. You may cancel your account at any time by sending us an email at <a class="text-link" href="mailto:support@sikahealth.com">support@sikahealth.com</a>. Upon any termination, discontinuation or cancellation of the Services or your account, the following Sections will survive: 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 14.</p>
          <p><strong>8. Warranty Disclaimers.</strong> THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. FURTHER, YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF YOUR COMMUNICATIONS AND INTERACTIONS WITH THE SIKA PLATFORM AND SERVICES AND WITH OTHER PERSONS WITH WHOM YOU COMMUNICATE OR INTERACT AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE PLATFORM AND SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LMN SERVICE PROVIDERS OR OTHER AUTHORIZED THIRD PARTIES.  FOR MARKETPLACE PURCHASES, WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER REGARDING THE PRODUCTS SOLD BY MERCHANTS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THEIR QUALITY, SAFETY, FUNCTIONALITY, OR HSA/FSA ELIGIBILITY. ALL SUCH PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED 'AS IS' BY THE RESPECTIVE MERCHANT. We make no warranty that the Services will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. We make no warranty regarding the quality, accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness or reliability of any information or content on the Services.</p>
          <p><strong>9. Indemnity.</strong> You will indemnify and hold Sika and its officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, penalties, losses, and costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees arising out of or in any way connected with (a) your access to or use of the Services, (b) your violation of these Terms, (c) an inaccurate LMN that is based on the health information you provide,  (d) your purchase of products with FSA/HSA funds for general or cosmetic purposes rather than for the declared medical purpose, (e) your purchase of certain products with FSA/HSA funds without a supporting LMN, or (f) your purchase of products through our Marketplace, including but not limited to product defects, delivery issues, or disputes with Merchants.<strong>‍</strong></p>
          <p><strong>10. Limitation of Liability.</strong></p>
          <p><b>(a)</b> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER SIKA NOR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, LOST SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT SIKA OR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. </p>
          <p><b>(b)</b> YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF YOU USE THE PLATFORM OR SERVICES DURING OR IN RELATION TO AN EMERGENT, SERIOUS, OR LIFE-THREATENING CONDITION, SUCH USE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. SIKA IS NOT LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY PERSON FOR ANY DECISION MADE OR ACTION TAKEN IN RELIANCE UPON INFORMATION INCLUDED AS PART OF THE PLATFORM OR SERVICES.</p>
          <p><b>(c)</b> SIKA IS NOT LIABLE TO ANY USER OR PERSON FOR ANY HARM CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OR MISCONDUCT OF ANY LMN SERVICE PROVIDERS, WHETHER OR NOT RELYING UPON INFORMATION COLLECTED, GENERATED, OR STORED VIA THE PLATFORM OR SERVICES. YOU EXPRESSLY RELIEVE SIKA OF ANY LIABILITY ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF ANY LMN SERVICE PROVIDER.</p>
          <p><b>(d)</b> SIKA IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, CLAIMS, OR DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF PRODUCT DEFECTS OR INACCURACIES, DELIVERY DELAYS OR FAILURES, OR MERCHANT CONDUCT RELATED TO MARKETPLACE PURCHASES. YOUR USE OF OUR MARKETPLACE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.</p>
          <p><b>(e)</b> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE LAW OF THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION, IN NO EVENT WILL SIKA’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES EXCEED THE LESSER OF THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID OR ARE PAYABLE BY YOU TO SIKA FOR USE OF THE SERVICES OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). </p>
          <p><b>(f)</b> THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN SIKA AND YOU.</p>
          <p>‍<strong>11. Governing Law and Forum Choice. </strong> These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The parties expressly consent to personal and exclusive jurisdiction in the state and federal courts located in New York, New York, and you and Sika each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.<strong>‍</strong></p>
          <p><strong>12. Arbitration Agreement. </strong>In the unlikely event that our support team is unable to resolve a complaint you may have (or if we have not been able to resolve a dispute with you after attempting to do so informally), including, but not limited to, any alleged breach of these Terms, you agree to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration. Arbitration, which is often less expensive, faster, and less formal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award, and may, but do not have to, award legal fees, arbitrator’s fees and costs, and other costs incurred by the party that does not win the dispute. You agree that any dispute will be exclusively, fully, and finally resolved using binding arbitration through the American Arbitration Association  (“<strong>AAA</strong>”).</p>
          <p><b>(a).</b> <u>Arbitration Procedure.</u></p>
            <p class="ml-40">  <b>(i)</b> You and Sika agree to employ three (3) arbitrators (the “<strong>Panel</strong>”), where one arbitrator (1) is selected by you, one (1) arbitrator is selected by Sika, and the third (3rd) arbitrator is selected by mutual consent of you and Sika. If you and Sika cannot agree upon the third arbitrator, the first two (2) arbitrators chosen shall select the third arbitrator. The selection decision shall be binding.</p>
            <p class="ml-40">  <b>(ii)</b> The arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online, and/or be solely based on written submissions—the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. Any judgment on the award rendered by the Panel may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
            <p class="ml-40">  <b>(iii)</b> Any claim or dispute arising under these Terms must be initiated by arbitration within two (2) years from its accrual date. Any claim or dispute initiated two (2) years or longer from its accrual date shall be time-barred and dismissed.</p>
          <p><b>(b)</b> <u>Cost of Arbitration.</u> Each party will pay the fees for its own attorneys, subject to any remedies to which that party may later be entitled under applicable law. In all cases where required by law, Sika will pay the arbitrator's and arbitration fees. If under applicable law Sika is not required to pay all of the arbitrator's and/or arbitration fees, such fee(s) will be apportioned between the parties in accordance with said applicable law. Any disputes regarding whether Sika is required to pay the arbitrator’s and arbitration fees and/or how those fees are to be apportioned between the parties will be resolved by the arbitrator.</p>
          <p><b>(c)</b> <u>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.</u> Sika may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Platform and Services or infringement of intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in the informal dispute-resolution process described above.</p>
          <p><b>(d)</b> YOU MAY ONLY RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH SIKA ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND MAY NOT BRING A CLAIM AS A PLAINTIFF OR A CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT ALLOWED UNDER THESE TERMS. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, YOU AND SIKA EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.</p>
          <p><b>(e)</b> <u>Opt-Out of Alternative Dispute Resolution Process.</u></p>
            <p class="ml-40">  <b>(i)</b> Notwithstanding the above, you can decline or “opt out” of the alternative dispute resolution process described above by contacting [insert email address] within 30 days of first accepting these Terms and stating that you (first and last name) decline this dispute resolution process.</p>
