        <div class="rich-text-block w-richtext">
          <p>At Sika Health, we value your privacy. This Privacy Policy (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) describes how Sika Health, Inc. (“<strong>Sika</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” or “<strong>our</strong>”) collects, uses, processes, and discloses personal information and personal health information (collectively, “<strong>Your Information</strong>”) when you use  the Services or communicate with us directly by email, text, or phone. Any capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy have the definitions given to them in our <a class="underline" href="https://www.sikahealth.com/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
          <p><strong><em>The term “Your Information” includes any information that can be used on its own or with other information in combination to identify or contact a natural person.</em></strong> Some of Your Information that we collect and transmit may be considered “health data” (<em>i.e.</em>, data related to your physical or mental health), “protected health information” or “PHI” (<em>i.e.</em>, information that relates to your past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition(s); the provision of health care to you; or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to you), and/or medical records as defined by state law. Although PHI is transmitted through the Sika platform in connection with the LMN Services, Sika is not a provider of healthcare services. Sika is a technology platform that enables, facilitates, and supports the acquisition of health-related products and services by users from third-party merchants.</p>
          <p>We may update or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will revise the “Last Updated” date above, and we may also choose to send you a notification of these changes.   We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy frequently to stay informed about our privacy practices and how you can exercise your options related to those practices. Your continued use of the Services will constitute your understanding and acknowledgement of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy or any subsequent updates, you must stop using the Services.</p>

            <li><strong>Information Sika Collects</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <p>We may collect the following types of information about you when you use the Services:</p>
          <p class="underline" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Information You Provide to Us</p>
          <p>We collect information that you provide to us directly when you use the Services, for example when you pay with Sika, or contact us directly with questions or feedback.  This information may include</p>
          <ul role="list" style="padding-left: 20px;">
            <li><strong>Identifiers</strong>, such as your name, email address, telephone number, billing address, gender, sex, birthdate, or a copy of your photo ID;</li>
            <li><strong>Purchase information</strong>, such as purchase date, time, or amount; </li>
            <li><strong>Self-reported health information</strong>, such as your medical history and symptoms; and</li>
            <li><strong>User Generated Content</strong>, such as personal information you include in comments or survey responses.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Note that if you pay with Sika, we use an integration with a PCI-DSS compliant payment processor to collect and process your payment, which payment processor is subject to change. If Sika uses a third-party payment processor, you will supply personal details and card information directly to the payment processor through a secure interface operated by that processor and Sika will not collect or store such details, which will be secured and kept confidential by the third-party processor under contract with us. However, your billing details, such as your payment card number provided to the payment processor, are handled and secured exclusively by the payment processor. The payment processor returns a token to Sika indicating your payment. Sika is not responsible for the payment processor’s data collection or storage.</p>
          <p class="underline" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Information We Collect Automatically</p>
          <p>We may automatically collect information about you when you access the Services.  This information may include the following:</p>

            <li><strong>Device information</strong>, such as device model, operating system language and version, unique device or personal identifiers, mobile network information, IP address, or browser type; or</li>
            <li><strong>Activity information</strong>, such as when you accessed the Services, which pages you viewed, and which sites you visited before and after accessing the Services.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We collect and store some of the information described in this subsection by using cookies and other similar technologies like pixels, tags, and web beacons (collectively, “Cookies”).  Cookies are small strings of information that a website you visit transfers to your browser.  Cookies can be used to track your internet activity, remember your preferences, or improve or localize your user experience.  Some cookies are necessary to operate a website, while others are not.

          <p class="underline" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Information We Collect from Third Parties</p>
          <p>We may collect information about you from third parties, for example by allowing third parties to place their own Cookies on the Services that help us with measuring site traffic and analytics. The information collected and stored by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and practices.  <br></p>
