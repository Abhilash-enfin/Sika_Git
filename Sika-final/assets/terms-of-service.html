          <p>Please read these Terms of Service (the “<strong>Terms</strong>”) and our Privacy Policy (“<strong>Privacy Polic</strong>y”) carefully because they govern your use of the Services.</p>
          <ol role="list">

          <p><strong>TERMS OF SERVICE</strong></p>

If we do, we’ll let you know by posting the updated Terms on the Sika website currently located at <a href="https://sikahealth.com">https://sikahealth.com,</a> and we may send other communications at our discretion or if required by applicable law. If you continue to use the Services after we have posted updated Terms, it means that you accept and agree to the changes. If you don’t agree to be bound by the changes, you may not use the Services anymore.

However, we have the right to do so for the purpose of operating the Services, to ensure compliance with these Terms, and to comply with applicable law or other legal requirements. We have the right to investigate conduct that affects the Services or violations of these Terms. We may also consult and cooperate with law enforcement authorities to prosecute users who violate the law.<strong>‍</strong></p>
          <p><strong>4. Links to Third Party Websites or Resources.</strong> The Services may allow you to access third-party websites or other resources. We provide access only as a convenience and are not responsible for the content, products or services on or available from those resources or links displayed on such websites. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any third-party resources.</p>
          <p><strong>5. Letters of Medical Necessity</strong>. </p>
          <p>            (a) Any LMNs and services relating to the provision of (or decision not to provide) an LMN through the Services are provided by                   independent practitioners (“<strong>LMN Services</strong>” as provided by “<strong>LMN Service Providers</strong>”).  Accordingly, if you choose to utilize the LMN                   Services, you may be subject to additional terms and conditions, including signing a Consent to Arrange Telehealth Appointment and                    Obtain Letter of Medical Necessity<strong> </strong>(“<strong>LMN Consent</strong>”).  To the extent applicable, you will receive a notification and have the                   opportunity to review, complete, and sign an LMN Consent.  IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY                   THOSE ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AND/OR CONSENT, DO NOT USE THE RELATED LMN SERVICES.</p>
          <p>           (b) In the event of any inconsistency between terms of use relating to LMN Services and these Terms, these Terms will control with respect                  to such LMN Services, unless otherwise expressly set forth in the LMN Consent. LMN Service Providers may collect and use certain                  information about you, as specified in the LMN Service Provider’s privacy policies. Prior to providing information to any LMN Service                  Provider, you should review their privacy policy. IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF AN LMN                  SERVICE PROVIDER’S PRIVACY POLICY OR TERMS OF USE, YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE RELATED LMN SERVICES. WE WILL NOT,                  UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY OF YOUR INFORMATION COLLECTED OR USED BY                  THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS.</p>
          <p>            (c) To the extent you desire to obtain a LMN, any such LMN will be based on personal health data and related information you provide via                   our Services. If you do not provide complete and accurate personal health information, the LMN you receive may not be accurate or                   appropriate. Questions and information collected through our platform in connection with the Services are designed for                   informational purposes and to facilitate the generation of a LMN for eligible customers. The Services and/or any data derived in                   connection with your use of the Services are in no way intended to replace the independent clinical judgment of a qualified healthcare                   professional. Further, in connection with LMNs, Sika is not responsible for retaining your personal health information in accordance                   with applicable medical retention rules. This is the responsibility of the LMN Service Providers, who are legally obligated to and will                   maintain such information in accordance with all applicable medical retention laws, rules, and regulations.</p>
          <p>           (d) LMN Service Providers are independent practitioners that provide LMN Services. LMN Service Providers may determine that you are                  not eligible for an LMN, in which case you will have no recourse against Sika. Sika has no, and expressly disclaims any, responsibility for                  any LMN Service Provider’s decision whether to issue you an LMN. </p>
          <p>                ANY MEDICAL ADVICE PROVIDED TO YOU BY AN LMN SERVICE PROVIDER OR ANY OTHER PROFESSIONAL IN CONNECTION                 WITH THE LMN SERVICES OR OTHERWISE IS NOT UNDER OUR CONTROL, NOR DO WE PROVIDE IT TO YOU OR USE IT.  </p>
          <p>           (e) By accepting these terms or by using the Services, you agree and acknowledge that Sika does not provide healthcare diagnosis and/or                  treatment services. Our role is limited to supporting and facilitating your ability to use your FSA and/or HSA funds as a payment                  method to acquire goods from third-party merchants, and to the extent needed facilitating eligible customers’ ability to use these                  funds by obtaining a LMN.  YOU AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SIKA IS IN NO WAY PROVIDING DIAGNOSIS OR TREATMENT                  TO YOU. YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE INFORMATION, PROCESSES, PRODUCTS, AND OTHER ITEMS                  REFERENCED AS PART OF THE SERVICES ARE NOT INTENDED AS A RECOMMENDATION OR ENDORSEMENT OF ANY COURSE OF                  ACTION, INFORMATION, OR PRODUCT. SIKA EXPLICITLY DISCLAIMS THE CREATION OF A PROVIDER-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP                  WITH YOU, AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY SUCH RELATIONSHIP IS BETWEEN YOU AND THE LMN SERVICE                  PROVIDER. </p>
          <p>           (f) THE SERVICES CANNOT, AND ARE NOT DESIGNED, INTENDED, OR APPROPRIATE TO, REPLACE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN                  HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS AND PATIENTS OR TO ADDRESS SERIOUS, EMERGENT, OR LIFE-THREATENING MEDICAL                  CONDITIONS AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. If you are a user and you or someone you know believes you                  are suffering an emergent or life-threatening condition, call 9-1-1 immediately where that service is available or go to the nearest open                  clinic or emergency room.</p>
          <p><strong>6. Suspension &amp; Termination.</strong> We may suspend or terminate your access to and use of the Services at our sole discretion, at any time and without notice to you. You may cancel your account at any time by sending us an email at <a href="mailto:support@sikahealth.com">support@sikahealth.com</a>. Upon any termination, discontinuation or cancellation of the Services or your account, the following Sections will survive: 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 14.</p>
          <p><strong>7. Warranty Disclaimers.</strong> THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. FURTHER, YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF YOUR COMMUNICATIONS AND INTERACTIONS WITH THE SIKA PLATFORM AND SERVICES AND WITH OTHER PERSONS WITH WHOM YOU COMMUNICATE OR INTERACT AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE PLATFORM AND SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LMN SERVICE PROVIDERS OR OTHER AUTHORIZED THIRD PARTIES.  We make no warranty that the Services will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis.

          <p><strong>9. Limitation of Liability.</strong></p>
          <p>            (a) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER SIKA NOR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS INVOLVED IN CREATING,                    PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,                    PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, LOST SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS                    OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE                    COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF                    OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),                    PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT SIKA OR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN                    INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED                    OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. </p>
          <p>             (b) YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF YOU USE THE PLATFORM OR SERVICES DURING OR IN RELATION TO AN EMERGENT, SERIOUS,                    OR LIFE-THREATENING CONDITION, SUCH USE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. SIKA IS NOT LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY PERSON FOR ANY                    DECISION MADE OR ACTION TAKEN IN RELIANCE UPON INFORMATION INCLUDED AS PART OF THE PLATFORM OR SERVICES. </p>
          <p>             (c) SIKA IS NOT LIABLE TO ANY USER OR PERSON FOR ANY HARM CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OR MISCONDUCT OF ANY LMN                    SERVICE PROVIDERS, WHETHER OR NOT RELYING UPON INFORMATION COLLECTED, GENERATED, OR STORED VIA THE                    PLATFORM OR SERVICES. YOU EXPRESSLY RELIEVE SIKA OF ANY LIABILITY ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF ANY LMN SERVICE                    PROVIDER.</p>
          <p>             (d) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE LAW OF THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION, IN NO EVENT WILL SIKA’S TOTAL                     LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES                     EXCEED THE LESSER OF THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID OR ARE PAYABLE BY YOU TO SIKA FOR USE OF THE SERVICES OR ONE                     HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). </p>
          <p>             (e) THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE                     BARGAIN BETWEEN SIKA AND YOU.</p>
          <p><strong>10. Governing Law and Forum Choice.</strong> These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The parties expressly consent to personal and exclusive jurisdiction in the state and federal courts located in New York, New York, and you and Sika each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.<strong>‍</strong></p>
          <p><strong>11. Arbitration Agreement</strong>.  In the unlikely event that our support team is unable to resolve a complaint you may have (or if we have not been able to resolve a dispute with you after attempting to do so informally), including, but not limited to, any alleged breach of these Terms, you agree to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration. Arbitration, which is often less expensive, faster, and less formal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award, and may, but do not have to, award legal fees, arbitrator’s fees and costs, and other costs incurred by the party that does not win the dispute. You agree that any dispute will be exclusively, fully, and finally resolved using binding arbitration through the American Arbitration Association  (“<strong>AAA</strong>”). </p>
          <p>You and Sika agree to employ three (3) arbitrators (the “<strong>Panel</strong>”), where one arbitrator (1) is selected by you, one (1) arbitrator is selected by Sika, and the third (3rd) arbitrator is selected by mutual consent of you and Sika. If you and Sika cannot agree upon the third arbitrator, the first two (2) arbitrators chosen shall select the third arbitrator. The selection decision shall be binding. The arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online, and/or be solely based on written submissions—the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. Any judgment on the award rendered by the Panel may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any claim or dispute arising under these Terms must be initiated by arbitration within two (2) years from its accrual date. Any claim or dispute initiated two (2) years or longer from its accrual date shall be time-barred and dismissed. </p>
          <p>Each party will pay the fees for its own attorneys, subject to any remedies to which that party may later be entitled under applicable law. In all cases where required by law, Sika will pay the arbitrator&#x27;s and arbitration fees. If under applicable law Sika is not required to pay all of the arbitrator&#x27;s and/or arbitration fees, such fee(s) will be apportioned between the parties in accordance with said applicable law. Any disputes regarding whether Sika is required to pay the arbitrator’s and arbitration fees and/or how those fees are to be apportioned between the parties will be resolved by the arbitrator.</p>
          <p>Sika may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Platform and Services or infringement of intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in the informal dispute-resolution process described above.</p>
          <p>YOU MAY ONLY RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH SIKA ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND MAY NOT BRING A CLAIM AS A PLAINTIFF OR A CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT ALLOWED UNDER THESE TERMS. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, YOU AND SIKA EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. </p>
          <p>Notwithstanding the above, you can decline or “opt out” of the alternative dispute resolution process described above by contacting legal@sikahealth.com within 30 days of first accepting these Terms and stating that you (first and last name) decline this dispute resolution process. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY NOT OPTING OUT OF THE ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS DESCRIBED, YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL TO WHICH YOU MAY OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ACTION OR LITIGATION IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS. If you opt out of the dispute resolution process described in this section of if this arbitration provision is found to be null and void, then all disputes arising under the Terms between us will be subject to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in New York City, New York , and you and we hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of these courts. You and Sika agree that if for any reason a dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration: (1) you and Sika waive any right to a jury trial; (2) the dispute will proceed solely on an individual, non-class, non-representative basis; and (3) neither you nor Sika may be a class representative or class member or otherwise participate in any class, representative, consolidated, or private attorney general proceeding.</p>
